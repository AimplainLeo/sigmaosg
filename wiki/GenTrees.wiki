#summary generate tree instancing positions based on shapefiles

= Introduction =

Using the GPU instancing we can create thousands of trees with very little cpu usage. This application generates a texturemap that will contain the positions for all trees based on the given shapefile.

The application can also remove trees from the "position texture" based on shapefiles used as masks. For example a shapefile that describes the road positions is well suited for this, we don't want trees in the middle of the road.

= Details =

An IVE file is created which contain all trees and shaders needed to render these trees. All you have to do is include the IVE into your scene.
